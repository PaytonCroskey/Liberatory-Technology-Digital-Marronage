  - Problem they're trying to solve: Voice assistants listening to people without their knowledge
  - Their solution: LeakyPick a technology that can be placed in different rooms that detects the presense of devices that stream audio to the internet. They do this by periodicaly emitting sounds and then monitoring network traffic. The device then provides an alert whenever the identified devices are streaming the noise.
  - Benefits:
    - Alerts users to cases when their IoT devices are listening in 
    - Low-cost ($40 to produce)
    - Simple to use
  - Drawbacks
    - According to their tests it 96% accurate, so still misses cases
    - As more IoT devices (namely voice assistants) flood the market it will be harder for this approach to scale, because they have the challenge of developing generalizable rules for noticing when a device is sending out audio.
