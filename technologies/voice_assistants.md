# Voice Assistant Technologies

### [LeakyPick:](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00500)
- **Creator(s):** Richard Mitev, Anna Pazii, Markus Miettinen, William Enck, Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi
- **Problem:** Voice assistants listening to people without their knowledge
- **Proposed Solution:** A portable technology that detects the presence of audio-streaming devices. It does this by periodically emitting sounds and monitoring network traffic. The tool then alerts users whenever microphones are 'listening.'
- **Benefits:**
  - Low-cost ($40 to produce)
  - Simple to use
  - 96% accurate, according to their tests.
- **Limitations:**
  - As more voice assistants flood the market, this approach will make it harder to develop generalizable rules for noticing devices sending out audio.

### [ClapperVsAlexa](https://voicebot.ai/2019/06/21/smart-speaker-privacy-in-a-homemade-box/)
- **Creator:** Engineer Chuck Carey
- **Problem:** Smart speakers are always listening
- **Proposed Solution:** A box called ClapperVsAlexa that sits on the listening device. When the box is open, the smart device operates normally, but with a clap, the box closes and plays sounds that prevent the microphone from listening.  
- **Benefits:** 
  - Grants agency to users
  - Drowns out the sound of human voices by overwhelming smart devices with other sounds and noises
- **Limitations:** 
  - This device is also always listening because it waits for a clapping sound. However, it follows the same structural architecture as the Clap-On lamp that’s been around since the 90s. 
  - The user has to be hypervigilant about their own conversation to utilize this liberatory technology correctly, which tends to be difficult. (Liken this to capturing funny or precious moments on camera- you don’t know when they’re going to happen, so you naturally don’t always have your camera out and open in front of you.) 
  - Another drawback is turning it off and allowing your device to operate fully. The functionality of this technology should be reversed (in that the liberatory technology stays on at all times, and then the user turns it off to use the smart device.)


### [Lofgren-Massie Ammendment](https://demandprogress.org/27-groups-urge-support-for-the-lofgren-massie-amendment-to-cjs-approps-to-rein-in-sec-702-of-fisa/)
- **Creator:** Representatives Lofgren, Massie, Jayapal, and Davidson
- **Problem:** FBI's exploitation of the Commerce, Justice, and Science(CJS) Appropriations Bill to retrieve information from databases of foreign intelligence information without a warrant.
- **Proposed Solution:** The Lofgren-Massie Amendment to CJS would close the loophole in CJS that the FBI uses to surveil Americans without a warrant. 
- **Benefits:** This amendment would prohibit warrantless searches of U.S. person's online public and private data. This amendment would also prohibit the encouragement from government agencies for companies to build "backdoors" into their products and services for convenient surveillance tactics.
- **Limitations:** This doesn't address the lack of consent in the process of surveillance. It only addresses how agents might be allowed to use the surveillance information once it has been collected.

### [Bhumika Speaks](https://projects.asiaweekly.com/bhumika-can-speak-for-herself/)
- **Creator:** Bhumika (Transgender Political Activist - Nepal) and Marc Lajoie (Chinese Reporter)
- **Problem:** General public misimformation about Transgender people and experiences
- **Proposed Solution:** Creating a dialogue about common misconceptions surrounding transgender identities. Uses interviews of Bhumika and other deep learning technologies to create an interactive platform where users can input questions about transgender identities. The technology then responds using Bhumika's own words.
- **Benefits:** 
    -  Highlights the voices of a transgender individual.
    -  Has a realistic response.
    -  Bhumika's authentic voice and political purpose are honored.
    -  Interactive.
- **Limitations:**
    -  Relies on technology from IBM, Google, and other historically harmful companies. 
    -  Cannot answer every question 


## Problematic Technologies
 
### [ShotSpotter Gun Detection Technology](https://www.shotspotter.com/)
- **Creator:** ShotSpotter
- **Problem:** The company uses acoustic sensors placed on buildings and lampposts to identify gunshots. However, it is generally inaccurate in differentiating between gunshots, fireworks, car backfire, and even NYC construction. Human employees are sent the sound recording and left to determine the type of noise. It relies on secretly placing microphones in neighborhoods deemed as “high crime,” a deeply racialized construct that leaves Black and Brown communities at risk. This technology brings police into residences to extreme degrees.
- **Our Potential Solutions:** 
  - Summoning a group of people to find and disable the microphone
  - Individually wearing sound-disrupting bracelets or accessories.
  - Creating a social network to report where police have been deployed in response to a call from Shotspotter’s sound recognition.
  - Playing loud music throughout the neighborhood as both a block party and an act of resistance.
- **Limitations:** Community solutions could emerge here, but ultimately getting rid of the tech is the goal. Also, so many communities of privilege are not impacted by this tech, so the most marginalized communities are left to resist it.
