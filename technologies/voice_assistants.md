LeakyPick 
  - Creator:
  - Problem they're trying to solve: Voice assistants listening to people without their knowledge
  - Their solution: LeakyPick a technology that can be placed in different rooms that detects the presense of devices that stream audio to the internet. They do this by periodicaly emitting sounds and then monitoring network traffic. The device then provides an alert whenever the identified devices are streaming the noise.
  - Benefits:
    - Alerts users to cases when their IoT devices are listening in 
    - Low-cost ($40 to produce)
    - Simple to use
  - Drawbacks
    - According to their tests it 96% accurate, so still misses cases
    - As more IoT devices (namely voice assistants) flood the market it will be harder for this approach to scale, because they have the challenge of developing generalizable rules for noticing when a device is sending out audio.

Technology Name - ClapperVsAlexa
- Creator: An engineer named Chuck Carey 
- Problem they're trying to solve: “an always-listening smart speaker”
- Their solution: A box called ClapperVsAlexa that sits on the device.  Imagine a Clap-on but geared to protect your privacy instead.  When the box is open, the smart device operates normally, but with a clap, the box closes and plays sounds that distract the device.  
- Benefits - what works in their solution? It works by a) offering a choice to the consumer that they otherwise didn’t have and by b) overwhelming the smart device with other sounds and noises to drown out the sound of human voice instead. 
- Drawbacks - what doesn't work in their solution? what communities does it exclude?  Some might argue that this device is also always listening, because it is looking for the clapping sound, but it follows the same structural architecture as the Clap-On lamp that’s been around since the 90s.  The two biggest drawbacks of this solution are first, that the user has to be hypervigilant about their own conversation to utilize this liberatory technology correctly, which tends to be difficult.  (Liken this to capturing funny or precious moments on camera- you don’t know when they’re going to happen, so you naturally don’t always have your camera out and open in front of you.)  The second drawback is turning it off and allowing your device to operate fully.  The functionality of this technology should be reversed (in that the liberatory technology stays on at all times, and then the user turns it off to use the smart device.)

[ShotSpotter Gun Detection Technology](https://www.shotspotter.com/) 
Creator: ShotSpotter

Problem they're trying to solve: The company uses acoustic sensors placed on buildings and lampposts to identify gunshots. However, it is generally inaccurate in differentiating between gunshots, fireworks, car backfire, and even NYC construction. Human employees are often sent the recording of the sound and are left to determine the type of noise. It relies on secretly placing microphones in neighborhoods deemed as “high crime,” a deeply racialized construct that leaves Black and Brown communities at risk. This technology brings police into neighborhood to extreme degrees.

My/Their solution: I attempted to search for solutions for a long time, and I found myself looking up “how to protect yourself from Shotspotter.” That left me feeling very disillusioned because this tech is posited as a way to protect communities. However, it has recorded conversations and been used in court. I would like to brainstorm possible solutions — maybe it is summoning a group of people to find and disable the microphones, individually wear sound-disrupting bracelets or accessories, or creating a social network to report on where police have been deployed in response to a call from Shotspotter’s sound recognition. 

Benefits - It is vital to have solutions to the use of this tech, and I haven’t been able to find much. 

Drawbacks - These solutions are possibly successful at protecting communities, but ultimately they are individualistic responses. Community solutions could emerge here, but ultimately getting rid of the use of this tech is the goal. Also, so many communities of privilege are not impacted by this tech, so the most marginalized communities are left to resist it.

- Lofgren-Massie Ammendment - https://demandprogress.org/27-groups-urge-support-for-the-lofgren-massie-amendment-to-cjs-approps-to-rein-in-sec-702-of-fisa/
  - Creator: Representatives Lofgren, Massie, Jayapal, and Davidson - 
  - Problem they're trying to solve: FBI's exploitation of the Commerce, Justice, and Science(CJS) Appropriations Bill in order to "incidentally" retrieve information from databases of foriegn intelligence information without a warrant.
  - Their solution: The Lofgren-Massie Amendment to CJS would close the loophole in CJS that the FBI is using to warrantlessly surveil Americans. 
  - Benefits: This amendment would prohibit warrantless searches of U.S. person's online public and private data. This amendment would also prohibit the encouragement from government agencies for companies to build "backdoors"  into their products and services for convenient surveillance tactics
  - Drawbacks: This doesn't address the lack of consent in the process of surveilling. It only addresses how agents might be allowed to use the surveillance information once it has been collected.

- Bhumika Speaks - https://projects.asiaweekly.com/bhumika-can-speak-for-herself/
  - Creator: Bhumika (Transgender Political Activist - Nepal) + Marc Lajoie (Chinese Reporter)
  - Problem they're trying to solve: Creating a dialogue about common misconceptions surrounding transgender identities
  - Their solution: Take an interview that Bhumika has and use other deep learning technologies to create a interactive platform where users can input questions about transgender identities, etc, and Bhumika can respond in her own words. 
  - Benefits - what works in their solution? 
      -  Highlights the voices of a trangender individual
      -  Has a realistic response
      -  Interactive (Ability for client to put in their own question)
  - Drawbacks - what doesn't work in their solution? what communities does it exclude? 
      -  Relies on technologies from IBM, Google, etc. 
      -  Cannot answer any/every question + trolling questions
