### [On Protest and Mourning](https://www.onprotestandmourning.digital/)
  - **Creator:** Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute (Curator: Grace Aneiza Ali)
  - **Problem:** Addressing the need for collective healing and mourning in the wake of the years 2020 and 2021 (memories of police violence in the midst of the pandemic).
  - **Proposed Solution**: “The digital exhibition brings together photographers and filmmakers who have recorded and borne witness to our uprisings and to our simultaneous insistence that the lives taken prematurely are mourned in public space.” 
  - **Benefits:** The digital exhibition combines physical evidence (photographs and video) with more subjective art that combines protest and mourning.
  - **Limitations:** - It can be triggering to view this content and difficult to grapple with.  On the flip side, I wonder to what level the screen creates distance and what kind of impact that has.

### [Therapy For Black Girls Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/7kPXrtK66kXyiqpKTtsqNN)
  - **Creator:** Dr. Joy Harden Bradford
  - **Problem:** Dr Joy is trying to subvert the stigma surrounding mental health, especially as it pertains to black women. 
  - **Proposed Solution:** Creation of a digital space that presents mental health topics in a more culturally relatable manner than institutional approaches. This space includes a Therapy For Black Girls Podcast which explores complex topics not limited to nagivating relationships, trauma, and anxiety. 
  - **Benefits:** This expands accessibility to mental health resources, practices, and understanding to a medium other than health care.
  - **Limitations:** This does not completely solve concerns of healthcare accessibility as it cannot be used as a replacement for mental health advising. The podcast format also neglects black women with hearing disabilities.

### [Inverse Surveillance Project](https://www.inversesurveillance.com/)
  - **Creator:** Assia Boundaoui, an Algerian-American filmmaker, writer and investigative journalist. Her award-winning feature-length directorial debut was THE FEELING OF BEING WATCHED, a documentary investigating a decade of FBI surveillance in Assia's Muslim-American community in Chicago.
  - **Problem:** The Muslim community in Boundaoui's childhood neighborhood was subject to decades of surveillance, harrassment, and policing by the FBI due to "suspected terrorist activity." 33,000 pages of (heavily redacted) FOIA documents were collected during a decade of FBI surveillance of the community, including her family. They remember being watched and questioned.
  - **Proposed Solution:** The creation of an AR counter archive to help process the trauma of being surveilled without the ability to even access many of the documents collected about them, with many being heavily redacted. The core of this project is developing a new arts-based model to address trauma from state surveillance and facilitate healing and care for our community, as a tool for liberation and power building.  
  - **Benefits:** The project uses a co-creation process with the communities in Chicago impacted by this surveillance. This is a site-specific installation for healing in that communitiy that takes the form of a labyrinth of records and the creation of a community counter archive, repurposing thousands of records collected during a decade of FBI surveillance, as a site of collective disruption and a reclaiming of narrative.  Within the labyrinth, the redacted spaces in the documents will be replaced by community photos, videos, etc likely using augmented reality. "Counter-extractive and a benefit to the community" is a key principle.
  - **Limitations:** There is still a limit to the ability for this project to hold the FBI accountable for the trauma they caused. There is also so much left hidden through the redacted documents that cannot be uncovered. Hopefully this project can be connected to disrupting ongoing surveillance practices against Muslims. Counter-extraction may be difficult.

### [Burqas and Beer Instagram Page](https://www.instagram.com/burqasandbeer/?hl=en)
  - **Creator:** Madinah Wardak, Afghan-American creator based in LA
  - **Problem:** Complete dearth of publicly shared information on Afghan refugee women experiences. Lack of space to process the trauma of being forced to leave your homeland due to American imperialism, to watch your country be destabalized and destroyed.
  - **Proposed Solution:** Community page to process those experiences, share writing, and share information. She often highlights clips of Afghan/South Asian historical figures and Black revolutionaries. There is lots of space in the comments to share and conversate and she responds often. She also created a podcast called Those Afghan Girls - a short-lived, unedited dialogue between two First Gen Afghan-American refugee women. It was an incredibly powerful and healing space to hear their reflections on being Muslim women. and survivors of U.S. imperialism, and how that vantage point allowed them to assess many current political issues.
  - **Benefits:** It is community specific yet also inclusive to all to learn, and she highlights key issues that need space for healing. 
  - **Limitations:** Although this space is so so needed, instagram isn't the best platform to facilitate this. There isn't much space to really meet other followers of the page, and the podcast she created was short lived and now can't even be found on the internet. It is strange and thought-provoking that something I listened to that was so moving and healing to me has now dissapeared and can't reach more people.
