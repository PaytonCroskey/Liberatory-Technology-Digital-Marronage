### On Protest and Mourning - https://www.onprotestandmourning.digital/
  - Creator: Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute (Curator: Grace Aneiza Ali)
  - Problem they're trying to solve: Addressing the need for collective healing and mourning in the wake of the years 2020 and 2021 (memories of police violence in the midst of the pandemic).
  - Their solution: “The digital exhibition brings together photographers and filmmakers who have recorded and borne witness to our uprisings and to our simultaneous insistence that the lives taken prematurely are mourned in public space.” 
  - Benefits - The digital exhibition combines physical evidence (photographs and video) with more subjective art that combines protest and mourning.
  - Drawbacks - It can be triggering to view this content and difficult to grapple with.  On the flip side, I wonder to what level the screen creates distance and what kind of impact that has.

### Therapy For Black Girls - Podcast-https://open.spotify.com/show/7kPXrtK66kXyiqpKTtsqNN
- Creator: Dr. Joy Harden Bradford
- Problem: Dr Joy is trying to subvert the stigma surrounding mental health, especially as it pertains to black women. 
- Proposed Solution: Creation of a digital space that presents mental health topics in a more culturally relatable manner than institutional approaches. This space includes a Therapy For Black Girls Podcast which explores complex topics not limited to nagivating relationships, trauma, and anxiety. 
- Benefits: This expands accessibility to mental health resources, practices, and understanding to a medium other than health care.
- Limitations: This does not completely solve concerns of healthcare accessibility as it cannot be used as a replacement for mental health advising. The podcast format also neglects black women with hearing disabilities.
