# Facial Recognition Technologies


### [The Dazzle Club](https://www.instagram.com/thedazzleclub/?hl=en)
- **Creator:** Emily Roderick, Georgina Rowlands, Anna Hart and Evie Price, in London
- **Problem:** Evading facial recognition in security cameras.
- **Proposed Solution:** Applying colorful abstract makeup to prevent cameras from detecting a face.
- **Benefits:**
  - Prevents facial tracking.
  - The group has bonded through this practice.
- **Limitations:** 
  - Requires a lot of prep and designing your face each day
  - May not be appropriate for certain situations + long term
  - Has a “cool/trendy” factor instead of a “practical” factor

### [Clothing that Confuses Facial Recognition Technology](https://www.businessinsider.com/clothes-accessories-that-outsmart-facial-recognition-tech-2019-10#blas-masks-also-explore-the-potential-of-algorithm-driven-facial-recognition-to-enact-bias-and-produce-false-positives-13)
- **Creator:** No specific creator, just different clothes designers
- **Problem:** Evading facial recognition software
- **Proposed Solution:** The clothing "dazzles" facial recognition software with misleading shapes making it difficult to detect a face
- **Benefits:**
    -  Works against a lot of facial recognition technology
    -  Community-led
    -  Low-tech
- **Limitations:**
    - Niche market. Unlikely to become mainstream, especially because the clothing is impractical.
    - This method will soon become outdated because algorithms are already being developed to overcome the clothing  

### [Fawkes](http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/fawkes/)
- **Creator:** UChicago SAND (Security, Algorithms, Networks, and Data) Lab
- **Problem:** Companies, law enforcement agencies, private entities and more use facial recognition software to discreetly identify people. They scrape images from the internet and use them to train their models to better watch the public.
- **Proposed Solution:** Fawkes "cloaks" an image by subtly altering the features that facial recognition systems depend on when storing a face. The software is designed to match you with the face template of someone who looks as much unlike you as possible, pulling from a database of random faces. 
- **Benefits:**
-  Effectively make you undetectable to facial recognition software and still allow you to post on the internet. 
-  Decreases the efficiency of facial recognition technologies
-  Gives users control over their facial data

- **Limitations:**
- Fawkes recreates AI's misidentification problem. If law enforcement runs a cloaked image through a facial recognition search, someone else will appear as a result. Thus, some uninvolved person may be subject to police arrest, interrogation or worse.
- It is not accessible to non-coders at the moment. The software may be used, but coding skills are required after download.
- There is already an abundance of uncloaked photos on the internet, making the technology less effective. 
- Does not protect your face from being recorded in person


### [Atlas of Surveillance](https://atlasofsurveillance.org)
- **Creator:** The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Reynolds School of Journalism at the University of Nevada, Reno
- **Problem:** Need a way to track and aggregate law enforcement tools of surveillance
- **Proposed Solution:** Combine crowdsourcing and data journalism to create the largest-ever repository of information on surveillance technology used by law enforcement agencies.
- **Benefits**
-  Open source, so it allows anyone to contribute or to learn how surveillance technology is spreading.
-  It is searchable for specific technical information.
- **Limitations:**
- There remains an unmet need for action.
- It is very reliant on volunteers' research.

## Problematic Technologies

### [Interpol Facial Recognition](https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Forensics/Facial-Recognition)
- **Creator:** Interpol
- **Problem:** IIdentifying “persons of interest” at international borders
- **Proposed Solution:** “Coupled with an automated biometric software app, this system is capable of identifying or verifying a person by comparing and analyzing patterns, shapes and proportions of their facial features and contours.” They use a database of images from an American AI company from which they draw their comparisons.
- **Benefits:** 
 - In theory, the technology is supposed to assist in apprehending criminals across international borders. When the image of the subject is entered into the system, it is automatically encoded and compared to the already stored profiles, which would contribute to the development of a global facial database.
- **Limitations:**
-  Almost always, there is a manual process carried out to verify the results of the automated system, which brings up questions about the necessity and efficacy of such a system.
-  Black, Arabic and Asian names/faces are likely targeted.


### [Cooler Screens](https://www.coolerscreens.com/)
- **Creator:** Arsen Avakian
- **Problem:** Desire to enhance the shopping experience in brick and mortar retail.
- **Proposed Solutions:** Cooler Screens is a company that utilizes facial recognition advertisements. With cameras and sensors embedded in the doors of refrigerated aisle sections. Companies like Walgreens advertise to their customers by recognizing factors like age and gender and displaying ads accordingly. These doors allow real-time analytics by noting which items customers looked at or picked up, and they shift what products are viewed based on what they think the customer will want to see.
- **Benefits:** tailored shopping experience, 
- **Limitations:** Cooler Screens makes assumptions about you based on clothing and appearance. What if your interests don't align with those of the people who dress like you? What if you don't consent to being surveilled while you're shopping?
