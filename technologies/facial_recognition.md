# Facial Recognition Technologies

## RAs - Place your found technologies under here. 

### Technology entry template:
- Technology Name - please include a link to the technology here
  - Creator:
  - Problem they're trying to solve:
  - Their solution:
  - Benefits - what works in their solution?
  - Drawbacks - what doesn't work in their solution? what communities does it exclude? 
  - More Information - extra links about the technology

### Example
- [Track This](https://trackthis.link/)
  - Creator - Mozilla Firefox
  - Problem - Advertisers track our data and show us targeted ads
  - Solution 
    - webapp that opens 100 tabs to “trick advertisers into thinking you’re someone else”
  - Benefits
    -  Attempts to obscure your data from advertising companies
  - Drawbacks
    - Opening 100 tabs requires a LOT of computational power - why can’t a person toggle the amount of tabs?
    - Redirecting rather than shielding - and returns to showing targeted ads after a while
    - Who determines the characteristics of each of these personas?

    - Creator: Four Artists in London
    - Problem they're trying to solve: How to prevent security cameras using facial recognition from finding them
    - Their solution: Painting their faces with different shapes and colors to reverse how the camera reads a face
    - Benefits:
        - Prevent themselves from being tracked
        - Bonding experience through the group/community they’ve built during the pandemic
    - Drawbacks: 
        - Requires a lot of prep + Designing your face each day
        - May not be appropriate for certain situations + long term
        - Has a “cool/trendy” factor instead of a “practical” factor

- Clothing that confuses facial recognition technology.
    - Creator: No specific creator, just different clothes designers
    - Problem: How to prevent cameras from using facial recognition to identify people
    - Solution: The clothing is meant to "Dazzle" facial recognition software with misleading shapes that prohibit the software from knowing what it is looking at
    - Benefits:
        -  Works against a lot of facial recognition technology
    - Limitations:
        - Niche market, unlikely to become mainstream especially because the clothing is impractical (ugly).
        - Algorithms are already being developed to overcome the clothing

  - Problem - Companies,Law Enforcement Agencies, etc. can search for your face across the internet through one-to-many identification (ex. police searching for criminal suspects using security-camera footage and a mug-shot database). Therefore, posts on social media or other places of your face could be identified extremely easily with facial recognition software that companies like Clearview AI have already developed. This web-scraping can also increase the accuracy of facial recognition tech to be used by law enforcement, for example, because they can create larger datasets to train the algorithms on. 
  - Solution 
    Fawkes converts an image — or “cloaks” it, in the researchers’ parlance — by subtly altering some of the features that facial recognition systems depend on when they construct a person’s face print. The software is designed to match you with the face template of someone who looks as much unlike you as possible, pulling from a database of celebrity faces. The goal is to more broadly significantly decrease the efficiency of facial recognition technologies like the one Clearview AI created by creating billions of cloaked photos on the internet that are unidentifiable.
  - Benefits
    -  It can effectively make you undetectable to facial recognition softwares, and still allow you to post on the internet. It can also help to wear down the efficacy of existing web-scraping, facial recognition software over time.
  - Drawbacks
    - It is not accessible to non-coders at the moment -- you can use the software but have to do some coding and download it to your computer. Also, some say there are already too many existing uncloaked photos on the internet, so the technology would be ineffective. However, if companies were mandated to cloak all of the photos on their sites, significant amounts of photos would be protected. This technology is not helpful at protecting you from your face being recorded in person, pre-web scraping, however. But hopefully this technology can make their algorithms fail.
