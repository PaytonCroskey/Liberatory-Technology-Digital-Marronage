# Facial Recognition Technologies

## RAs - Place your found technologies under here. 

### Technology entry template:
- Technology Name - please include a link to the technology here
  - Creator:
  - Problem they're trying to solve:
  - Their solution:
  - Benefits - what works in their solution?
  - Drawbacks - what doesn't work in their solution? what communities does it exclude? 
  - More Information - extra links about the technology

### Example
- [Track This](https://trackthis.link/)
  - Creator - Mozilla Firefox
  - Problem - Advertisers track our data and show us targeted ads
  - Solution 
    - webapp that opens 100 tabs to “trick advertisers into thinking you’re someone else”
  - Benefits
    -  Attempts to obscure your data from advertising companies
  - Drawbacks
    - Opening 100 tabs requires a LOT of computational power - why can’t a person toggle the amount of tabs?
    - Redirecting rather than shielding - and returns to showing targeted ads after a while
    - Who determines the characteristics of each of these personas?

### Your Technologies Below:
- [The Dazzle Club](https://www.instagram.com/thedazzleclub/?hl=en)
    - Creator: Four Artists in London
    - Problem they're trying to solve: How to prevent security cameras using facial recognition from finding them
    - Their solution: Painting their faces with different shapes and colors to reverse how the camera reads a face
    - Benefits:
        - Prevent themselves from being tracked
        - Bonding experience through the group/community they’ve built during the pandemic
    - Drawbacks: 
        - Requires a lot of prep + Designing your face each day
        - May not be appropriate for certain situations + long term
        - Has a “cool/trendy” factor instead of a “practical” factor

- Clothing that confuses facial recognition technology.
    - Creator: No specific creator, just different clothes designers
    - Problem: How to prevent cameras from using facial recognition to identify people
    - Solution: The clothing is meant to "Dazzle" facial recognition software with misleading shapes that prohibit the software from knowing what it is looking at
    - Benefits:
        -  Works against a lot of facial recognition technology
    - Limitations:
        - Niche market, unlikely to become mainstream especially because the clothing is impractical (ugly).
        - Algorithms are already being developed to overcome the clothing
