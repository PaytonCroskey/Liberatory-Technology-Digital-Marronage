# Social Media Technologies

### [Block Party](https://www.blockpartyapp.com/)
  - **Creator:** Tracy Chou
  - **Problem:** Online Harassment
  - **Proposed Solution:** Anti-harassment tools against online abuse. But more fundamentally, solutions for user control, protection, and safety. Creates Lockout Filters, Block Lists, and a "Helper" View that allows a user you trust to filter through what you've locked out.
  - **Benefits:**
     - Works well with existing technologies
     - Grants users agency
  - **Limitations:**
     - Reactionary. It doesn't take into account other ways of reimagining social media
     - Shifts the problem downstream for others to deal with

### [Mark Yourself Unsafe](https://www.markyourselfunsafe.com/)
  - **Creator:** Movement for Black Lives in partnership with ad agency J. Walter Thomas
  - **Problem:** Black communities face continual danger in the US.
  - **Proposed Solution:** Reversal of Facebook's mark yourself safe feature. Instead of marking themselves "safe," Black people across the United States can mark themselves as unsafe.
  - **Benefits:**
    - Individuals can share their unsafe status on Facebook and Twitter
    - Can bring attention to local problems occurring across the country.
  - **Limitations:**
    - The link for the website is marked as unsafe by Google, which is a deterrent to usage
    - Lack of action(s) after marking oneself as "unsafe"

### [Be Real](https://bere.al/en/ambassadors)
  - **Creator:** Alexis Barreyat
  - **Problem:** Pressure to curate our physical lives on digital spaces
  - **Proposed Solution**: An anti-Instagram social media app that asks people to post their 'real' selves at random times throughout the day.
  - **Benefits:** 
    - Less curated social media content.
    - Small enough platform now where people feel safe to have friends hold them
    - accountable.
    - Personalizable.
  - **Limitations:**
    - Can still encourage radical exclusionary groups
    - Encourages more digital extraction from users

### [Vero](https://vero.co/vero-mission)
  - **Creator:** Ayman Hariri
  - **Problem:** Ad and algorithm-based social media can cause several privacy and health problems such as ad profiling and increased stress levels.
  - **Proposed Solution:** Vero aims to create a "pure" form or "Next-Gen" social media without restricting content algorithms, data mining, or ads.
  - **Benefits:**  You control what you want to see without the interference of market activity or preference-based algorithms.
  - **Limitations:**  Vero is subscription-based, and they sell Analytics data to their service provider to have an analytics platform

### [Womaze](https://womaze.com/)
  - **Creator:** Three sisters, Rebecca, Leah, Hannah Wiser (high school and college students,) and their mom, Corin.
  - **Problem:** A lack of access to wellness and mental health resources that is consistent and curated.
  - **Proposed Solution:** An app that they call your "toolbox for life" that has easy-to-navigate sections related to your immediate needs/interests. They have short quotes, embedded articles, or videos you can watch and like to save them in different "toolboxes." Also, the app sends you a notification a day with an uplifting quote called "push motivations," like "Notice how you feel in this moment. Ask yourself: what do I need right now?" You can also share your resources with others very easily.
  - **Benefits:** It is a curatable platform without excessive, overwhelming amounts of information. This platform finds a way to make the world feel smaller, a way to feel less alone. Also, the push motivations are a way for the user not to have to do all the work to help their mental health. The app shows a sense of care by consistently sending uplifting messages.
  - **Limitations:** It's not very communal (i.e., no messaging or social networking in the app), and the information is only curated by Womaze staff. Also, the content is a bit limited. They don't have many resources related to healing or self-care from racism and racialized trauma. This app seems to understand mental health in a colorblind way

## Problematic Technology

### [Life360](https://www.life360.com/)
  - **Creator:** Chris Hulls
  - **Problem:** In many ways, technology enables us to live very private lives away from our friends, families, and loved ones. 
  - **Proposed Solution:** Life360 offers access into your life by way of your phone and provides peace of mind for location services, digital safety, driving safety and emergency assistance. Parents can better understand what their children are doing, and adults can make sure their friends are physically safe. 
  - **Benefits:** If someone in your circle ends up in a dangerous situation, the app can notify friends and family and urge emergency services to be called. 
  - **Limitations:** It is invasive and detracts from independence. Especially because parents primarily use it to track their children. It also requires a paid subscription, which might bar some families from using the app in the most helpful ways.
