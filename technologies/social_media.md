### Womaze -- https://womaze.com/:
  - Creator: Womaze was created by three sisters — Rebecca, Leah, and Hannah Wiser (high school and college students — and their mom, Corin.
  - Problem they're trying to solve: A lack of access to wellness and mental health resources that is consistent and curated. 
  - Their solution: An app that they call your "toolbox for life" that has easy to navigate sections related to your immediate needs/interests: spirituality, in a funk?, meditations, etc. They have short quotes, embedded articles, or videos you can watch and like to save them in different "toolboxes." Also, the app sends you a notification a day with an uplifting quote called "push motivations" like "Notice how you feel in this moment. Ask yourself: what do I need right now?" You can also share your resources with others very easily through various means including text and social media.
  - Benefits - It is a very curatable platform without excessive, overwhelming amounts of information. It reminds me of the digital garden idea from the readings since it seems to fit within ideas of the "slow web" that is supposed to feel like a calming experience. This platform finds a way to make the world feel smaller, a way to feel less alone. Also, the push motivations are a way for the user to not have to do all the work to help their mental health, the app shows a sense of care by consistently sending uplifting messages.
  - Drawbacks - It's not very communal (ie no messaging or social networking in the app) and the information is only curated by Womaze staff, not everyone. Also, the content is a bit limited as in they don't have many resources related to healing or self-care from racism and racialized trauma. This app seems to understand mental health in a colorblind way

### Life360 - https://www.life360.com/
  - Creator: Chris Hulls
  - Problem they're trying to solve: In many ways, technology enables us to live very private lives from our friends, families, and loved ones.  Those walls can be drawn up against other people and on a simple basis, information can be kept away.
  - Their solution: Life360 offers access into your life by way of your phone and offers peace of mind for location services, digital safety, driving safety and emergency assistance.  Parents can have a better sense of what their children are doing and adults can make sure their friends are physically safe. 
  - Benefits - If someone in your circle ends up in a sticky situation, or something goes awry, the app can notify friends and family and urge emergency services to be called.  The peace of mind is one of the greatest attractions to the app.  
  - Drawbacks - A lot of people find it invasive of privacy and detracts from independence.  It also requires a paid subscription which might bar some families from using the app in the ways that are most helpful to them.
