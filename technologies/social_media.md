### Block Party: (https://www.blockpartyapp.com/)
  - Creator: Tracy Chou
  - Problem they're trying to solve: anti-harassment tools against online abuse, but more fundamentally solutions for user control, protection, and safety.
  - Their solution: Creates Lockout Filters, Block Lists, and a "Helper" View (Allow a user you trust to filter through what you've locked out)
  - Benefits - what works in their solution?
     - Works well with existing technologies
     - Allows people to be aware of everything that is going on social media or not --> gives them agency
  - Drawbacks - what doesn't work in their solution? what communities does it exclude? 
     - Reactionary, doesn't take into account other ways of reimagining social media
     - Shifts the problem downstream which is manageable for some people
  - More Information - extra links about the technology
      - Another tech I have heard about is called HalloApp
