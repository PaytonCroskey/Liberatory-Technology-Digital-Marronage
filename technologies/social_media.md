     - Works well with existing technologies
     - Allows people to be aware of everything that is going on social media or not --> gives them agency
  - Drawbacks - what doesn't work in their solution? what communities does it exclude? 
     - Reactionary, doesn't take into account other ways of reimagining social media
     - Shifts the problem downstream which is manageable for some people
