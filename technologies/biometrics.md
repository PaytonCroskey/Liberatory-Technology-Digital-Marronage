# Biometric Technologies

### [Finger Print Hacking](https://blog.kraken.com/post/11905/your-fingerprint-can-be-hacked-for-5-heres-how/)
- **Creator:** Kraken Security Labs Team
- **Problem:** Biometric data is easily hackable.
- **Proposed Solution:** A demonstration of how simple it is to "steal a fingerprint."
- **Benefits:**
    - Successfully shows an easy, inexpensive way to steal a fingerprint that most people could also do with practice
    - Proves that a fingerprint is not a secure alternative to a strong password

- **Limitations:**
    - The demonstration is concerned with protecting crypto assets, not necessarily human privacy.
    - This hack highlights interpersonal violence and does not necessarily speak to corporations' data misuse.

### [Political Lace](https://www.wundermanthompson.com/insight/activist-wearables)
- **Creator:** Melissa Coleman
- **Problem:** Raising Awareness about Childbirth?
- **Proposed Solution:** A lace collar whose LED light blinks every time a young woman dies from childbirth
- **Benefits:**
    - Raises awareness
    - Provides consumers with the chance to "wear what they stand for"
    - Demonstrates the use of art as a tool

- **Limitations:**
    - Performative without action
    - Removes awareness of the root causes of the problem itself
    - Removed from communities that are most affected by the problem. (e.g., Black and Brown women)

### [SmartCap](https://www.mining3.com/solutions/smartcap/)
- **Creator:** Mining3 and SmartCap
- **Problem:** Truck drivers and miners falling asleep while working
- **Proposed Solution:** Headband that uses EEG technology to monitor brain activity. Then the results are analyzed to determine levels of alertness. The device then sends early warnings if they notice the wearer is fatigued.
- **Benefits:**
    - Could prevent accidents
    - The technology is comfortable and wearable (can fit under hard-hats or beanies easily)   
- **Limitations:**
  - The notifications are a closed circuit so a driver could theoretically ignore them
  - Ignores the root of the problem - that drivers and miners have to work such dangerous, long hours

### [ION - infant optical scanning technology](https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2018-09-12-researchers-develop-biometric-tool-for-newborn-fingerprinting.aspx)
- **Creator(s):** University of California San diego researchers
- **Problem:** Infant identification is inefficient because of their size, movements and behaviors.
- **Proposed Solution:** Develop a portable biometric tool for fingerprinting and palm printing of infants and children as early as the first day of birth. Instead of relying on existing adult fingerprinting technologies, their solution is developed from the ground up with infants.
- **Benefits:** Eliminates the need for paper identification and allows rapid identification to retrieve patient history and support timely vaccinations and treatments. It is portable and works via laptops and cellular devices.
- **Limitations:** 
  - A data breach or compromise of such a device would expose "encrypted" templates of the prints of many children and infants that could potentially be decrypted.
  - Misidentification of a child or infant could mean exposure to the wrong treatments.
  - Expedites the surveillance of targeted communities, especially by police, by collecting fingerprints at birth.

## Problematic Technologies

### [Dangerous Things](https://dangerousthings.com/about-implants/)
- **Creator:** Amal Graafstra
- **Problem:** People’s general forgetfulness for keys, passwords, etc. when trying to access things that they might get otherwise locked out of. 
- **Proposed Solution:**  Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) implants in the body and is used to unlock doors, phones and more. For $40, the company sells a “body hacking kit which includes Near Field Communication (NFC) chips, RFID chips and biomagnets and a sterilized injection needle to insert the device.”
- **Drawbacks:** 
  - There is no FDA approval because these aren’t medical devices. Graafstra explains that they had the option to get approval but decided against it because it would restrict who can do installations.
  - It’s unclear whether the data on the chips are locally stored or are on the cloud. 
  - Many credit and debit cards use RFID, and information can still be stolen. This isn’t as secure a biometric technology as it implies.

### [Use of Biometric Identification Tech in the Occupied Palestinian Territories](https://international-review.icrc.org/articles/ihl-hr-facial-recognition-technology-occupied-palestinian-territory-914)
  - **Creator:** Israeli company AnyVision (Israeli Govt)
  - **Problem:** They are seeking to make more efficient the ability to regulate and control the movement of Palestinians at checkpoints and for work permits.
  - **Proposed Solution:** Palestinians who request permits to enter Israel must first get photographed and fingerprinted at an Israeli military office. Their photos are stored in a biometric database and are connected to electronic ID cards they scan at the checkpoint. Facial recognition software at the checkpoint matches their face to their photos in Israel’s biometric database.
  - **Benefits:** This is effective for them because biometrics are so unique and specific to the person that vast masses of data can be collected and searched in reference to particular people. Already, around 450,000 Palestinians have electronic ID cards and are therefore known to have their facial data stored in databases by Israel.
  - **Limitations:** - This directly serves to facilitate the oppression and ongoing occupation of Palestinians and Palestinians don’t have the ability to opt out. This programming has gone on without much scrutiny from organizations or countries, yet they have collected so much information.
  - **More Questions:** What liberatory tech could emerge in resistance to this process? Would it be low-tech? How do we address the fact that Palestinians, by necessity, have to provide the most accurate information (meaning their identities are hypervisible and vulnerable to the state) in order to travel and move around?
