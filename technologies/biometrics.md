  - Creator: Melissa Coleman
  - Problem they're trying to solve: Raising Awareness about Childbirth?
  - Their solution: Create a fashion statement with a light that blinks every time a young woman dies from childbirth 
  - Benefits - what works in their solution?
      - Aesthetic?
      - Does prove a point
  - Drawbacks - what doesn't work in their solution? what communities does it exclude? 
      - Doesn't provide much action
      - Impractical to wear
      - Removes awareness of the root causes of the problem itself
      - Removed from communities that are affected by the problem 
  - More Information - extra links about the technology

- Life headband
  - Creator: Mining3 and SmartCap (Australian company)
  - Problem they're trying to solve: Truck drivers and miners falling asleep while working
  - Their Solution: Headband that uses EEG technology to monitor brain activity.  Then the results are analyzed to determine levels of alertness.  The device then sends early warnings if they notice the wearer begins to fatigue (predictive).
  - Benefits:
      - Could prevent accidents
      - The technology is comfortable and wearable (can fit under hard-hats or beanies easily)   
  - Drawbacks
    - The notifications are a closed circuit so a driver could theoretically ignore them

- ION - infant optical scanning technology - https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2018-09-12-researchers-develop-biometric-tool-for-newborn-fingerprinting.aspx

  - Creator(s): University of California San diego researchers (e.g. Eliah Aronoff-Spencer)
  - Problem they're trying to solve: infant identification inefficiencies because of the size, movements and behaviors of infants. Past attempts have tried to extrapolate adult technologies in order to successfully fingerprint children. 
  - Their solution: Develop a portable biometric tool for fingerprinting and palmprinting of infants and children as early as the first day of birth. Instead of relying on existing adult fingerprinting technologies, their solution is developed from the ground up with infants.
  - Benefits: Eliminates the need for paper identification and allows rapid identification to retrieve patient history and support timely vaccinations and treatments. It is portable and works via laptops and cellular devices.
  - Drawbacks: A databreach or compromise of such a device would expose "encrypted" templates of the prints of many children and infants that could potentially be decrypted. Misidentification of a child or infant could mean their exposure to the wrong treatments. Additionally, this tool could be used to extend the act of surviellance and criminalizing through surveillance onto children and infants.
