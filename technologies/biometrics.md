# Biometric Technologies

- **[Finger Print Hacking](https://blog.kraken.com/post/11905/your-fingerprint-can-be-hacked-for-5-heres-how/)**
  - **Creator:** Kraken Security Labs Team
  - **Problem:** breakdown trust of biometric data collection by exibiting ways it can be hacked
  - **Proposed Solution:** demonstrating process of "stealing a fingerprint"
  - **Benefits:**
      - successfully shows easy, inexpensive way to steal a fingerprint that most people could also do with practce
      - shows A fingerprint should not be considered a secure alternative to a strong password
  - **Limitations:**
      - data protection framed in a way of protecting crypto assests, not necessarily human privacy
      - hack is more interpersonal violence and does not necessarily speak to corporation violence and maluse of data

- **[Political Lace](https://www.wundermanthompson.com/insight/activist-wearables)**
  - **Creator:** Melissa Coleman
  - **Problem:** Raising Awareness about Childbirth?
  - **Proposed Solution:** Create a fashion statement with a light that blinks every time a young woman dies from childbirth 
  - **Benefits:**
      - Aesthetic?
      - Does prove a point
  - **Limitations:**
      - Doesn't provide much action
      - Impractical to wear
      - Removes awareness of the root causes of the problem itself
      - Removed from communities that are affected by the problem

- **[SmartCap](https://www.mining3.com/solutions/smartcap/)**
  - **Creator:** Mining3 and SmartCap (Australian company)
  - **Problem:** Truck drivers and miners falling asleep while working
  - **Proposed Solution:** Headband that uses EEG technology to monitor brain activity.  Then the results are analyzed to determine levels of alertness.  The device then sends early warnings if they notice the wearer begins to fatigue (predictive).
  - **Benefits:**
      - Could prevent accidents
      - The technology is comfortable and wearable (can fit under hard-hats or beanies easily)   
  - **Limitations:**
    - The notifications are a closed circuit so a driver could theoretically ignore them
    - Ignores the root of the problem - that drivers and miners have to work such dangerous, long hours

- **[ION - infant optical scanning technology](https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2018-09-12-researchers-develop-biometric-tool-for-newborn-fingerprinting.aspx)**
  - **Creator(s):** University of California San diego researchers (e.g. Eliah Aronoff-Spencer)
  - **Problem:** infant identification inefficiencies because of the size, movements and behaviors of infants. Past attempts have tried to extrapolate adult technologies in order to successfully fingerprint children. 
  - **Proposed Solution:** Develop a portable biometric tool for fingerprinting and palmprinting of infants and children as early as the first day of birth. Instead of relying on existing adult fingerprinting technologies, their solution is developed from the ground up with infants.
  - **Benefits:** Eliminates the need for paper identification and allows rapid identification to retrieve patient history and support timely vaccinations and treatments. It is portable and works via laptops and cellular devices.
  - **Limitations:** A databreach or compromise of such a device would expose "encrypted" templates of the prints of many children and infants that could potentially be decrypted. Misidentification of a child or infant could mean their exposure to the wrong treatments. Additionally, this tool could be used to extend the act of surviellance and criminalizing through surveillance onto children and infants.

- **[Dangerous Things](https://dangerousthings.com/about-implants/)**
  - **Creator:** Amal Graafstra
  - **Problem:** People’s general forgetfulness for keys, passwords, etc. when trying to access things that they might get otherwise locked out of. 
  - **Proposed Solution:** RFID implants in the body that are supposed to be convenient for people.  This is supposed to be a convenient approach that melds human beings and technology in something called biohacking. 
  - **Benefits:** For the small price of $40, the company sells a “body hacking kit which includes NFC chips, RFID chips and biomagnets and a sterilized injection needle to insert the device.”
  - **Drawbacks:** There is no FDA approval because these aren’t medical devices.  Graafstra explains that they had the option to get approval, but decided against it because it would restrict who can do installations (which is a really scary thought- that just anyone can implant these chips).  It’s unclear whether the data on the chips are locally stored or are on the cloud.  A lot of credit and debit cards use RFID and information can still be stolen- this isn’t as secure a biometric technology as it implies.

## Problematic Technologies

- **Use of Biometric Identification Tech in the Occupied Palestinian Territories [https://international-review.icrc.org/articles/ihl-hr-facial-recognition-technology-occupied-palestinian-territory-914](https://international-review.icrc.org/articles/ihl-hr-facial-recognition-technology-occupied-palestinian-territory-914)**
    - **Creator:** Israeli company AnyVision (Israeli Govt), possibly Amazon & Goodle
    - **Problem:** They are seeking to make more efficient the ability to regulate and control the movement of Palestinians at checkpoints and for work permits.
    - **Proposed Solution:** Palestinians who request permits to enter Israel must first get photographed and fingerprinted at an Israeli military office. Their photos are stored in a biometric database and are connected to electronic ID cards they scan at the checkpoint. Facial recognition software at the checkpoint matches their face to their photos in Israel's biometric database.
    - **Benefits:** This is effective for them because biometrics are so unique and specific to the person that huge masses of data can be collected and searched in reference to specific people. Already, around 450,000 Palestinians have electronic ID cards and are therefore known to have their facial data stored in databases by Israel.
    - **Limitations:** - This directly serves to facilitate the oppression and ongoing occupation of Palestinians and Palestinians don’t have the ability to opt out. This programming has gone on without much scrutiny from organizations or countries, yet they have collected so much information.
    - **More Information:** Again, like last week, I am left wondering what strategies of resistance could look like. What liberatory tech could emerge in resistance to this process? Would it be low-tech? How do we address the fact that Palestinians, by necessity, have to provide the most accurate information (meaning their identities are hypervisible and vulnerable to the state), in order to travel and move around? Would love to brainstorm and discuss the ways that biometrics have predominately emerged out of a security and movement control logic.
