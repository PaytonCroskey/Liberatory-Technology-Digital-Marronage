- Finger Print Hacking - https://blog.kraken.com/post/11905/your-fingerprint-can-be-hacked-for-5-heres-how/
  - Creator: Kraken Security Labs Team
  - Problem they're trying to solve: breakdown trust of biometric data collection by exibiting ways it can be hacked
  - Their solution: demonstrating process of "stealing a fingerprint"
  - Benefits - what works in their solution?:
      - successfully shows easy, inexpensive way to steal a fingerprint that most people could also do with practce
      - shows A fingerprint should not be considered a secure alternative to a strong password
  - Drawbacks
      - data protection framed in a way of protecting crypto assests, not necessarily human privacy
      - hack is more interpersonal violence and does not necessarily speak to corporation violence and maluse of data

  - Problem they're trying to solve: Raising Awareness about Childbirth?
  - Their solution: Create a fashion statement with a light that blinks every time a young woman dies from childbirth 
  - Benefits - what works in their solution?
      - Aesthetic?
      - Does prove a point
  - Drawbacks - what doesn't work in their solution? what communities does it exclude? 
      - Doesn't provide much action
      - Impractical to wear
      - Removes awareness of the root causes of the problem itself
      - Removed from communities that are affected by the problem 
  - More Information - extra links about the technology

- Life headband
  - Creator: Mining3 and SmartCap (Australian company)
  - Problem they're trying to solve: Truck drivers and miners falling asleep while working
  - Their Solution: Headband that uses EEG technology to monitor brain activity.  Then the results are analyzed to determine levels of alertness.  The device then sends early warnings if they notice the wearer begins to fatigue (predictive).
  - Benefits:
      - Could prevent accidents
      - The technology is comfortable and wearable (can fit under hard-hats or beanies easily)   
  - Drawbacks
    - The notifications are a closed circuit so a driver could theoretically ignore them
