  - Creator - Mozilla Firefox
  - Problem - Advertisers track our data and show us targeted ads
  - Solution 
    - webapp that opens 100 tabs to “trick advertisers into thinking you’re someone else”
  - Benefits
    -  Attempts to obscure your data from advertising companies
  - Drawbacks
    - Opening 100 tabs requires a LOT of computational power - why can’t a person toggle the amount of tabs?
    - Redirecting rather than shielding - and returns to showing targeted ads after a while
    - Who determines the characteristics of each of these personas?
