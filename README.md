## Research Question: How do we design liberatory technologies?

Liberatory: Anything that pushes for the increased freedom and wellbeing of marginalized peoples

Technology: A tool used to accomplish a task

### Project Description 

This project aims to explore liberatory technologies and forms of digital marronage and cultivate a technological toolbox that is both secure and transformative. We‚Äôre interested in surveying existing technical solutions to concerns around facial recognition, voice assistants, biometric technologies, social media, and protest safety. Recognizing that existing digital interventions aren‚Äôt always successful ‚Äî how can we repurpose compelling aspects of these solutions from our ‚Äúidea graveyard?‚Äù How do we design technical methods centered on liberation and digital marronage that honor community knowledge? Finally, how may individuals protect themselves from the state while also being able to dance in the sun? This research will culminate in a prototype liberatory technology proposed by RAs and a Zine to present their research findings.
